- Microcontroller (Arduino or ESP32)
- Computer
- Python Programming Language
- Machine Learning Libraries
- GitHub

## Artificial Intelligence Technique Used
This project uses a machine learning classification technique.
The model is trained using temperature data to predict the temperature status.

## How the System Works
1. The temperature sensor reads temperature values.
2. Data is sent to the microcontroller.
3. The values are processed by the AI model.
4. The system classifies the temperature condition.
5. The result is displayed to the user.

## Conclusion
